# Coding-Assignment-3-Data-Bias
**Overview of Assignment:** In the course of this project, my primary objective was to investigate the concept of bias within natural language processing models, focusing specifically on the Perspective API developed by Google Jigsaw. To accomplish this, I engaged in a thorough examination of a dataset containing internet comments and their corresponding scores. The central methodology involved formulating my own queries and utilizing the Perspective API client to assess the toxicity levels of each comment.

Throughout the project, I actively sought to understand and analyze the performance of the Perspective API, particularly in discerning potential biases in its toxicity predictions. My role encompassed the careful evaluation of the obtained toxicity scores, aiming to uncover patterns and insights that could illuminate the model's behavior.

In essence, I immersed myself in querying the Perspective API and interpreting the results within the context of bias. By navigating the dataset and formulating personalized queries, I gained firsthand experience in how the model responds to different types of language. This project provided a valuable opportunity to explore the nuanced dynamics of bias within natural language processing models, offering insights into the complexities and considerations inherent in the development and application of such technologies.
